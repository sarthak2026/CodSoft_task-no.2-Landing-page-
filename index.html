          <p>
            Growing and managing mango trees require attention
             to several key factors to ensure healthy growth and
              optimal fruit production.Mango trees thrive in tropical
               and subtropical climates. They require plenty of sunlight
                and warm temperatures to flourish. Ensure you're planting
                 them in an area where they can receive full sun for most
                 of the day.
